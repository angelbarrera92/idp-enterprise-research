# IDP For enterprises - Research

In this repository, you'll find my research on the topic of Internal Development Platforms (IDP) for enterprises.
When I say "enterprise" I mean a company with many different teams, each with its codebase and each with its way of working.

## What is an IDP?

An IDP is a platform that is used by multiple teams to build their applications.

## Why do we need an IDP?

In a large enterprise, there are many teams, each with its codebase, and with its way of working.
This leads to a lot of duplication of effort, and a lot of wasted time.
An IDP can help solve this problem.

### Micro platforms

In the end, teams develop their own "micro platforms" on top of the services the enterprise provides them.
Micro platforms are a set of tools and processes that are used by a team to build their codebase.
Each team has its micro platform, and each micro platform is different.
Maintaining all these micro platforms is a lot of work, and it leads to a lot of duplication of effort.

## Services at companies

Developers at companies use a lot of services to build their codebase, most of which are provided by the company.
These services are often used similarly by the teams, but they are not always used in the same way (Micro platforms).

## Disclaimer

This is just my research, and it is not a complete list of all the things that need to be considered when building an IDP.
I'm not an expert on the topic, and I'm not affiliated with any company.
This is just my vision based on my experience working in large enterprises.
This could be not the state of my current employer, and it could be not the state of my previous employer.

This repository is a work in progress, and I'll be updating it as I learn more about the topic.
